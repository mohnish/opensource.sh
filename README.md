## OpenSource

OpenSource is a tiny shell script that allows you to add the type of license you wish to add to your project.

### Installation

- Download the zip file and copy it to the home directory `~`. It should look
something like `~/opensource/`.
- Then `cd ~/opensource/` and `chmod 755 opensource.sh`.

### Usage
- `cd ~/opensource/` and `opensource.sh [options] /path/to/project`
- For a list of options available with `opensource.sh`, you can use the `-h` flag.
It can be used as: `opensource.sh -h` or `opensource.sh --help`.


### TODO

- Add support to multiple opensource licenses
- Add support to mulptiple file formats such as text, raw etc.

I happen to be new to shell scripting, so please do pardon my poor coding style & quality. I would love to have people push updates to this repository to fix/improve the existing code. Thanks in advance. Suggestions for betterment of the project are welcome.
